Prefix:  I want to take you on a tour of my hometown.  

USA slide:
I grew up in Seattle, WA, located in the state of Washington in the Northwest corner or the United States

Seattle's a booming metropolis, with 600,000 living within the city limits, but over four million in the greater metropolitan area.

Seattle's bordered by two mountain ranges, the Olympics to the West, and the cascades to the East.

The Olympics are a temperate rainforest, receiving over three meters of percipitation annually in the form of rain and snow. They're a major destination for skiing, backbackping, bicycling, and hotsprings.

In the West are the Northern cascades.  The Northern cascades sport jagged peaks. The tallest, mt. Raineer, stands at 13000, or just slightly over 4000 meters.  I spent my youth running around them hills, hiking and skiing.  Most beautiful land on god's green earth. 

--Seattle overview
When you come in to the city, you'll want to find your way up one of the hills.  From Queen Anne, you can see the space needle, the city's most famous landmark, and the downtown skyline.  The space needle was built for the 1962 world's fair, and was designed to look like a spaceshift shooting off flames.  The space needle sits guides you to the Seattle center, which hosts Seattle's biggest music and arts festivals. Let's head down and take a look

-- Ballard locks, where the lake meets the Sound. Salmon travel up the rivers to spawn annually, then head back to the sea.  You can watch them make the journey.  We always dared each other to catch them with our hands, but never did.
